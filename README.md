# VetCare (Android version)

Assistant for animal nursing, with reminders and easier health collection. 

## Concept

Animals in pet hospitals have a treatment plan that nurses must apply at given times. The app should act as a reminder, to “enforce” the plan for each animal. 
In addition, biosignals monitoring could help tracking the animal conditions.
An important point is to be able to quickly identify an animal.

## Main Features

* Task list with all the tasks for the day.
* Possibility to mark any task as completed by reading the QR Code associated to the animal.
* Tasks synchronized with Google Calendar.
* Animal identification with NFC.
* All important animal's information presented in its profile and also biosignals (simulated) like temperature and heart beating presented in chart.
* Possibility to discharge animal and generate a report with important information about the time the animal was hospitalized.
* Reports directly saved in Google Drive.
* Possibility to send message to the animal's owner without having to insert his phone number.
* Possibility to add new animal without the need to have a computer nearby.
* Calendar with all tasks scheduled.
